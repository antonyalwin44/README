## 🚀 About Me

My name is Antony Alwin S. I completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) and am now pursuing my Master of Computer Applications (MCA) at SA Engineering College. I am very interested in web development and enjoy working with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development. I also have experience with databases like MySQL and enjoy building websites and learning new things in programming.
